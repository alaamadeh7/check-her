# 📶 Signal Processing Project

Welcome to the **Signal-project** – a practical and educational project designed to explore the fundamentals and applications of **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** using Python.

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates key signal processing techniques such as:

- Generating and visualizing signals
- Filtering (low-pass, high-pass)
- Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Convolution
- Sampling and reconstruction

It's perfect for students, researchers, or anyone interested in how signals are processed and analyzed in real-world systems.
