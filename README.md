# 📶 Signal Project

This is a **Signal Processing Project** that explores core concepts such as signal generation, transformation, and analysis. It’s designed to help students understand how real-world signals can be modeled, visualized, and manipulated using tools like Python or MATLAB.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- Signal types (continuous, discrete)
- Sine and cosine wave generation
- Sampling and aliasing
- Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Filtering (Low-pass, High-pass)
- Noise addition and removal

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python / MATLAB
- **Libraries (Python)**:  
  - NumPy  
  - Matplotlib  
  - SciPy

## ▶️ How to Run (Python version)

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Signal-project.git
cd Signal-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
Signal-project/
├── main.py               # Main script for processing
├── signals/              # (Optional) Stored/generated signals
├── plots/                # Output signal visualizations
├── report.pdf            # (Optional) Project explanation
└── README.md             # Project documentation

### A quick check:

Can you tell me:

1. Is it in Python, MATLAB, or something else?
2. What is the **goal** of the project? (e.g. Fourier analysis, signal filtering, etc.)
3. Do you have graphs or outputs to include?

Once I know that, I can make the README perfect for your version.
